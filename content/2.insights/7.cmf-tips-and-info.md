# CMF Application Tips & Info

## Background
- The Canada Media Fund (CMF) has its roots in Telefilm, which was established in the 1960s. Over the years, it has evolved to support a broader range of media.
- CMF is run and administered by Telefilm, which means it operates within the framework and guidelines set by Telefilm.
- The language used in film production is different from game development. E.g., in the film industry, "production fund" refers to the active creation of the project, while "development" refers to pre-production activities.
- Banks are typically reluctant to provide bridge financing for games. This type of financing is used to cover expenses before the release of the game, which can be risky for banks.
- The definition of "done" varies between film/TV and games. This can lead to confusion and miscommunication when dealing with funding and project completion.
- The CMF is aware of these issues and is actively working to improve its processes and guidelines.

## Experimental programs
- Convergent programs are designed for broadcast TV.
- Experimental programs cater to Interactive Digital Media (IDM) and software projects.

## Budget cap
- CMF can fund up to 75% of a project's budget.
- The maximum funding amount is $1.5 million across all programs.

## Fiscal Year
- The fiscal year starts on April 1 and ends on March 31. This is when new budgets, deadlines, and guidelines are refreshed.

## Programs
1. Accelerator partnership: A program designed to foster partnerships and collaborations.
2. Commercial projects program: This program focuses on projects with strong commercial potential.
3. Conceptualization: This is a first-come, first-served program that provides up to $15k for testing a proof of concept.
4. Prototyping: A selective program aimed at building a functional prototype for testing and validating concepts.
5. Innovation and Experimentation: A highly competitive program with a long lead time, aimed at funding IDM projects that push the boundaries of innovation.

### Conceptualization
- This program is first-come, first-served and provides up to $15k for testing a proof of concept.
- It serves as an entry point for future rounds of funding.

### Prototyping
- This program is selective and not first-come, first-served.
- It's designed to help build a functional prototype for testing and validating concepts.
- There are spring and fall deadlines, and the budget is split between these two periods.

### Innovation and Experimentation
- This program is very competitive and requires a long lead time.
- It's designed to fund IDM projects that are innovative and push the boundaries of what's possible in the field.

### Commercial Projects Program
- This program is similar to the Innovation program but has a stronger focus on commercial viability.

## Tips
1. Read the guidelines carefully and repeatedly, especially for selective/scoring matrix programs.
2. Weight your application according to the scoring grid, spending the most time and effort on highly scored sections.
3. Set up your online account well in advance.
4. Understand the importance of diversity and gender considerations in your application.
5. Work systematically against the list of required documents.
6. Talk to other developers who have successfully navigated the process before.
7. Allow plenty of buffer time to compile the necessary documentation.
8. Ensure your budget aligns with the CMF framework.
9. The core of your application should be your innovation.

Remember, the CMF does not cover 100% of the budget - it's intended to provide support, not full funding.

## Changes to guidelines (2022)

The overall budget for the Canada Media Fund (CMF) remains the same as in previous years, and the flexibility measures introduced in response to the pandemic will continue.

### Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Programs
- EDI programs, which were launched in 2021, will be expanded this year.
- The definition of diverse communities now includes 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals and persons with disabilities, in addition to Indigenous and racialized communities. The definition can be found in section 2.1.1 of the program guidelines and in appendix A.
- The term "gender balance" now includes "individuals that identify as women".
- Only paid positions are considered when assessing diversity and inclusion.
- The CMF is introducing a new Accessibility Support initiative to assist individuals who face barriers to completing the CMF application process.
- The CMF is formally launching PERSONA-ID, a new self-identification system designed to measure and monitor the demographic representation and participation of all individuals with ownership and control on projects seeking CMF funding. This system is required to earn points for EDI, but is otherwise voluntary.

### Experimental Stream
- The CMF is encouraging applicants to implement more environmentally sustainable practices. This may become a requirement in the future.
- Previously, applicants who had received any funding from an interactive Experimental Stream Program were excluded from applying to the Program. Now, the exclusion only applies to applicants who have received previous production funding from an interactive Experimental Stream Program. Applicants who have previously received funding from the Conceptualization and/or Prototyping Programs are now eligible to apply.
- At least 25% of the Conceptualization Program's budget will be exclusively reserved for projects where at least 40% of the enumerated eligible positions are held by members of diverse communities.
- The insurance requirements have been updated.
- There have been changes in the reporting requirements for digital media.

### Convergent Stream
- Nothing relevant.
