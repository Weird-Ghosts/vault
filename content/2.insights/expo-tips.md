# Rocket Adrift Tips for In-Person Expositions

_Thanks Lindsay, Sloane, and Titus!_

- Comfy chairs for folks playing and working the booth.
  - Can be pricey to rent so try to bring your own somehow.
- Bring additional branding materials.
  - Decoration stuff like table skirts, flowers, and things can help.
- Secondary monitor running trailer with branding.
  - Or possibly bringing Steam Decks for more players.
- Dress to impress!
  - Cheap t-shirts can be fun.
  - Matching jackets are very cool.
- Bring garbage collection and cooler for snacks/drinks.
- B2B (business-to-business) is a tough calculation so make sure itâ€™s worth the time off and price.
  - Are you reaching players?
- Print lots of postcards and business cards!
  - Make postcards with a blank space so you can add your contact info if needed.
  - You can get them sent to the hotel ahead of time - Henry.

And a special tip from Henry: bring lozenges!
