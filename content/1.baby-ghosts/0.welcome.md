# Baby Ghosts Cohort Meetings

Every Monday during Stage 1, we host a 1.5-hour meeting for all Baby Ghosts in the cohort. We will present a new topic relating to studio development every week. The final 30 minutes is optional and is a time to check in, share progress, and ask questions of mentors and fellow studios. We'll also use this time to share resources and opportunities that we think might be useful to you.
