## Releasing a Game
- GDCo’s default response on release window nowadays is as follows: “Don’t release during a Steam quarterly mega-sale for visibility reasons. Don’t release the same week as a major competitor in the same subgenre for ‘influencer reach’ reasons. And maybe Q4’s a bit dicey, possibly, maybe. Otherwise, have at it!"
