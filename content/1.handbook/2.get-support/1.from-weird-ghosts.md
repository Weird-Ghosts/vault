## Slack Information/Tips

**Welcome to the Weird Ghosts Slack!**

The main focus of our Slack is to connect all of our investees and share information social impact and studio management. Messages are organized into channels, which are like chat rooms. You can join any channel you want, and you can also create your own channels.  We have a few channels that are important to know about:

- Our [#general](https://weirdghosts.slack.com/archives/C02LS46FQTZ) channel is for all important Weird Ghosts announcements, such as events, workshops, and new investments.
- [#alumni-chat](https://weirdghosts.slack.com/archives/C03SJ99HGUF) is a place for Weird/Baby Ghosts alumnus to share their work and offer information to new investees. Don’t hesitate to reach out in this chat for advice about the program from others who have done it already. 
- We also have two informational channels, [#social-impact](https://weirdghosts.slack.com/archives/C043SAKUWM8) and [#social-media](https://weirdghosts.slack.com/archives/C045MBHMT8F) for designing and sharing strategies related to growing your studio.
- And finally, there is the most important channel, [#pets](https://weirdghosts.slack.com/archives/C039L7119DZ) where you can share all your animal friends!
