# Conflict of Interest Policy

At Weird Ghosts, we are committed to acting in the best interests of our community at all times. This means avoiding any real or perceived conflicts of interest. This policy applies to all staff, General Partners, mentors, partners, and other leaders associated with Weird Ghosts.

## Definition of Conflict of Interest

A conflict of interest arises when a person's private interests — personal, financial, or professional — may potentially interfere with or influence their ability to make impartial decisions on behalf of Weird Ghosts. This includes, but is not limited to, personal gain, gain for immediate family, or gain for business partners.

## Declaration of Conflict of Interest

All individuals associated with Weird Ghosts should disclose any real or perceived conflicts of interest as soon as they become aware of them. This includes connections with groups or individuals doing business with Weird Ghosts. While this can be done annually as part of a review, it should happen at any point when an individual recognizes that the potential for conflict exists.

## Management of Conflicts of Interest

When a conflict of interest is declared, the individual should not participate in any decision-making processes related to the matter in question. The officers of Weird Ghosts will determine what, if any, contribution the individual can make to the discussion leading to a decision. 

## Transparency and Accountability

Weird Ghosts is committed to transparency and accountability in all our operations. We believe in the principles of Brave, Honest, Kind, and Humble actions, as outlined by Kai Cheng Thom in the Loving Justice framework. This means taking personal responsibility, standing against systemic oppression and harmful power dynamics, telling the whole story, declaring and neutralizing conflicts of interest, and demonstrating attention to the needs and safety of all involved.

## Review and Sign-off

All individuals associated with Weird Ghosts will review and sign off on identified conflicts of interest annually. The record of these conflicts will be kept with the minutes.

This policy is designed to be flexible and is open to feedback and critique. It will be reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure it continues to serve the best interests of our community.
