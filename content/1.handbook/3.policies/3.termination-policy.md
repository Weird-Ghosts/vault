# Termination/Exit Policy

If at any point you decide that you would like to leave the Baby Ghosts program, you're free to do so. We ask that you let us know in writing (via email) so we have a record of your decision. After we receive your message, your participation in the program will end immediately unless we communicate another end date to you.

The Baby Ghosts team also has the right to end this agreement. If we decide to do this, we promise to tell you why. The reasons might be things like if the program is ending, if we can't provide the support we promised, or if there are repeated problems like missing meetings or not fulfilling your other obligations under this agreement.

Please understand that if this agreement ends for any reason, you'll need to stop using any of the resources, support, or other benefits from the Baby Ghosts program, unless we communicate otherwise to you in writing.

Where possible, and on the rare case that we have to terminate the agreement, we will do our best to offer some support in terms of exiting the program and next steps.
